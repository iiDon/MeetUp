      "Casale is a privately owned Swiss Company, wholly owned by Casale Holding, with headquarters in Lugano (Switzerland). Casale can trace its origins to the pioneering age when the ammonia industry was born, at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, ammonia was only industrially produced in Germany by Badische Anilin and Soda Fabrik (“BASF”) using its proprietary Haber-Bosch process. In this process, owing to the relatively low synthesis pressure, water scrubbing of the reacted gases was used to capture the product ammonia as an aqueous solution, which would then undergo subsequent steps of purification in order to obtain pure ammonia. Luigi Casale, an italian chemist, devised an innovative scheme deciding to operate the ammonia synthesis at a much higher pressure than BASF’s one, thus obtaining directly liquid ammonia. Ammonia Casale, the original company’s name, was therefore established in 1921 with the purpose to license the newly patented process.",
